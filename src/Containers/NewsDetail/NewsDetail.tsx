Every store has to work on making a deal on their own merchandise, separately.<p>- In a show of solidarity, all employees, whether floor workers or corporate IT, must work holidays and instead have floating holidays for time off.

You could argue in addition that Mondragon has been limited by a) Spain having been a dictatorship until the 1980s, b) the relative youth of the EU single market vs that of the US leading to a more regional business culture and c) the additional language barriers in Europe that make business expansion a bit slower than in the US.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mondragon_Corporation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mondragon_Corporation</a>',

Though it should be said that no one in Iceland really touches quite how regressive American social conservatives are.

Iceland functions because they make their government function anyway. Nothing about being small makes it easier for two opposing parties to somehow figure out a way to get the damned bills paid. You could replace the entire American republic with Donald Trump and Barack Obama, and we&#x27;d get no more done than we do today, because the government isn&#x27;t trying to solve problems.

It&#x27;s handled at the industry level rather than individual companies, but when you start a job, you are pretty much automatically enrolled in the union relevant for your work. A little money comes out of your paycheck, and the union is there in case you have problems.<p>The unions also provide other benefits. For example, most of them own summer houses that any member can reserve to go spend a weekend away. You rarely hear the average Icelander on either side of the worker&#x2F;manager divide complain about them at all. Everyone more or less views them as beneficial.<p>Once or twice a year they make headlines when one group of workers or another feels aggrieved and it escalates to a brief strike in some small sector of the economy, but on the whole, I don&#x27;t think many Icelanders would trade their system of employment for ours.<p>Like so many other areas, I think the problem is that we in the US are just so very much worse at running our society and country than most other comparable countries. Look at health care. No one liked the ACA; no will will like the AHCA or whatever the Republicans pass. The problem isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s impossible to do a decent job at a health care system. The problem is that we specifically suck. Put us in charge of anything, and we&#x27;ll turn it into something awful that doesn&#x27;t work, but provides some brief period of outsized shareholder value.',

The big a-hole studios realize this and charge sub-prime wages because after they burn a dev out there will be another to replace them still starry-eyed from a childhood playing games.<p>I have read several stories of people leaving game deve for a nice boring job writing insurance software for more money and fewer hours. Many could be doing it the other way around, write software for a lame, but lucrative, insurance company, then make a small lifestyle business writing indie games with a few friends.',

After the war; WWI iirc, the framework was applied to other industries.<p>So if you don&#x27;t want to work 40 hours, don&#x27;t. I have much less sympathy for a software engineer who has better leverage than a kid who works at McDonalds and couldn&#x27;t earn a living wage working 60 hours.<p>The fact that you could strike and not really sacrifice much; and if it failed find another job, puts you in a great position.

Basically if the stock went up the price of that acquisition plus two billion dollars, that is a very powerful price signaling and a difficult command to disobey.<p>It means there&#x27;s an opportunity cost: all other things being equal, it would cost Amazon two billion dollars in market capitalization to NOT do whatever the hell Wall Street THINKS they&#x27;re going to do with Whole Foods.<p>Maybe the market thinks they&#x27;re going to use them as bases for grocery distribution: reward, the cost of acquisition plus a bonus two billion. Maybe the market thinks they&#x27;re going to gut the company, fire everybody, and then there&#x27;s one less competitor for what Amazon means to do with groceries! Maybe the market thinks they&#x27;ll take the existing Amazon grocery stuff and rebrand it Whole Foods and the rabble will buy into that for a time.<p>The point is that this money really isn&#x27;t free: it&#x27;s conditional on whether Amazon does what the investors think they&#x27;re gonna do, with the acquisition. If Amazon fails to do that, the market capitalization can evaporate.<p>My own hunch is that the market thinks Amazon is super efficient and acquisitive, and that Whole Foods is weak and inefficient and misguided. As such, the expectation of greedy and amoral investors is that Amazon will take over and whip Whole Foods into shape, maybe even fire everybody and replace &#x27;em with Amazonians, and that will make Whole Foods &#x27;better&#x27; and justify the exercise. They certainly aren&#x27;t buying into Whole Foods&#x27; &#x27;enlightened&#x27; memes: that has no place on Wall Street.<p>So I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s BECAUSE Whole Foods has been &#x27;enlightened&#x27; that the prospect of wrecking that so motivates investors. They figure that the Amazon way is clearly the winning way, and they figure there will be a BIG difference in how things are done, and it&#x27;s a difference they characterize as &#x27;good for capital&#x27;, so there&#x27;s a synergistic effect that makes it &#x27;free&#x27; for Amazon plus a bonus. And then Amazon is obligated to do what&#x27;s expected of them, which I think is probably kinda predictable.',

Amazon could turn this $13 billion business into a $130 billion business by plugging WF into Amazon&#x27;s existing apparatus for merchandising, pricing, inventory control, online sales, logistics, and direct-to-consumer delivery.<p>Taking WF market share up from 2% to 20% is a much bigger opportunity than going the other direction, and just using WF stores to sell Amazon&#x27;s grocery assortment.',

Hot summer days spent making $3.35 an hour standing over pressure cookers full of 400 degree hot oil and lifting 50 pound baskets of deep fried chicken out of them.  You get a 15 minute paid break every 4 hours, and a mandatory 30 minute unpaid break for lunch.<p>I&#x27;m not saying its ok to be inhumane or break laws and treat your workers like cattle.  I&#x27;m just saying that if you&#x27;ve never worked at a minimum wage unskilled job before, you probably don&#x27;t realize how much it can be hell, just due to the nature of the work.  The same thing can be said for lots of labor like farming, construction work, mining, etc.',

If a company treats some set of its workers badly, what stops them from treating other employees the same way? \nIn this case, they may treat SW engineers well because there is a lot of demand for engineers, and they have to be treated well to retain good folks. That is not comparable to the good culture that OP claims WF has.',

If you took 1,000 average citizens and threw them into minimum wage food service, factory, or warehouse work, I would completely expect a good percentage of them to burn out and quit within a couple days.  Unskilled jobs are just too hard and require too much effort for too little salary to make them acceptable to a lot of people.  This doesn&#x27;t mean they are inhumane; it means we&#x27;ve grown accustomed to easy, white-collar jobs and are fairly divorced from the reality of hard, physical labor these days.',

It doesn&#x27;t work everywhere with everybody.<p>I&#x27;m just guessing, but I&#x27;d think WF would tighten up the philosophy a little, probably focus on whole and natural foods more than some of the other philosophies as that can scale.  That would mean maybe leading a little less with local, FT, and only organic in favor of whole and natural food.  Perhaps some more brand name stuff on the shelves.  It provides a great way to roll out Go with a customer base that is probably receptive to it.   THen I&#x27;d expect more technology stuff,  curb side pickup,  maybe even free delivery from amazon to WF stores for pickup,  maybe.<p>You cant change WF too much or it just breaks and people like it for what it is.

Their packaging is great, the quality of the food is great.  It is a luxury purchase but although the prices are more than at my local store, they are less than what I would pay at WF.  Most importantly, the delivery times are very flexible and easy to arrange...with the same great search engine amazon uses for everything else.  I tried a few other grocery delivery services over the years and they couldn&#x27;t promise any delivery window, their packaging was terrible, and you had to be there in person to get the groceries.<p>As an aside, the amazon fresh packaging is great as trash bags.  The ice packages they send along are great to put in your freezer and use later on trips.  They recently (at least to me) added a durable cloth-based cooler, which they say you can put on your porch and they will reuse.  I may let them have it back or I might use it as a cooler for my normal grocery store trips.<p>It is slightly more expensive, but the bottom line is that in the middle of the week I am just too worn out to go to the store, so being able to have a mid or end week delivery means that I have stuff at home instead of having to order out.<p>I guess I qualify as an amazon fanboy ;-)<p>Relevance to this HN story, I think they can probably leverage this to help their Amazon Fresh business.',

They show up on time, almost never have a stocking issue and the packaging is very well designed - the frozen stuff is packed with dry ice, the cold stuff with an ice pack and the rest are packed into reinforced paper bags that are sealed to prevent stuff falling out en-route. It takes only moment to move everything into my kitchen and I&#x27;ve never had something break en-route.<p>Customer support is much better too - every time my order was missing an item, I&#x27;d have to call Safeway and often I simply couldn&#x27;t reach someone (especially outside of 9-5).<p>Grocery stores need to up their game quickly or they will go the way of Sears and K-Mart.',

I do like whole foods, a bit expensive, I use co-ops when possible to source food, but Amazon will make sure to gut headcount and compromise on quality anywhere possible to make an extra penny. Bezos farms all this money simply to be the richest and to play with rockets in space while we all suffer from shrinking middle class, lower education standards for most, cancer and an energy crunch. Bezos is dangerously smart, possibly the smartest business man alive or ever, but he is just not a good man. Every one of his successes requires the original to be sacrificed at their hands. using their infrastructure - aws - guarantees that if you are successful there Bezos will steal your model and compete with you.<p>I knew whole foods was falling at the hands of Costco, organic for cheaper, but whole foods had great variety and did try harder than all the other big-chain food stores.<p>Every scamazon victory feels like a loss of the world.<p>Time to bust this trust.

Before being acquired by Amazon, it had a crazy amazing working culture and customer service reputation, and it still does: in fact, that&#x27;s why Amazon bought it. They wanted to learn from that culture and bring it to Amazon.<p>I doubt WF is going to find themselves watering things down - I think they are going to be spending their time learning something from Amazon about logistics and data-driven growth, but they&#x27;re going to spend a lot of time teaching Amazon about how running a store that has fans as much as it does customers, about how to make that work.<p>That means they will have to stay true to their cause: Fair Trade and organic deals are part of WF&#x27;s core brand, and if they remove them, they will lose their fans. What Amazon will want to figure out is how to make that more economic by scaling it. It might be the best thing to happen for animal welfare in the food chain this generation.<p>Store automation is an interesting one. What Amazon have been trying to figure out is how to take away the pain points of stores (queueing), but that does not mean all staff are removed. Stock needs checking, shelves need stacking, and in my local supermarkets the checkout is already semi-automated, but I still have to queue. Amazon&#x27;s plan is just to take that further. Does it mean you could have fewer staff? Yes, of course, but you could also decide instead of growing profits, grow the brand: redeploy those staff into genuine customer service roles.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting move, I think. I don&#x27;t think you need to be alarmed if you&#x27;re at WF, you need to be alarmed if you&#x27;re at Walmart, Tesco or any other major food retailer anywhere on the globe though.',

There&#x27;s no universal reference for what scores &quot;mean&quot;. You can give candidates from, say 0-5 stars in terms of how much support you want to give them in the race. That&#x27;s it. 5 = most support, 0 = no support. It&#x27;s ONLY relative to the actual pool of candidates in the election. People can just learn to understand this clear fact, and ballots can be marked as such as &quot;least support&quot; to &quot;full support&quot;. And educating people about this is easier than educating them about IRV and all it&#x27;s weirdness (and more honest than making false claims about IRV). There are NO cultural issues or biases or problems here in terms of what a score &quot;means&quot;.<p>&gt; If you want to fix the problems caused by loser elimination in IRV…<p>I don&#x27;t know what you mean here, but it isn&#x27;t IRV, it&#x27;s some other rank system.

And that all the providers of goods feeding the Amazon supply chain must earn their own profits to survive so that they can keep feeding Amazon, on Amazon&#x27;s terms.<p>And most of all the problem is that the penalty for failing to earn these wages&#x2F;supplier profits is death, because there&#x27;s no alternate system pumping capital down to where consumers do their choosing. Amazon is TOO efficient and a world based on that ethos can&#x27;t maintain a consumer class at all.

Whether it&#x27;s inefficiency, inability to pivot to new ways of doing things, or just markets that dry up as they&#x27;re replaced by something else, companies have a hard time staying in such powerful positions in our society for long.</i><p>Geoffrey West makes a compelling argument that it&#x27;s due to the scaling laws around growth itself. The capitalist system demands exponential growth, but companies eventually reach a size where all their resources are devoted to maintaining existing &quot;biomass.&quot; The exact scaling depends on the scaling properties of the networks that &quot;feed&quot; each &quot;cell&quot; of the system — circulatory&#x2F;respiratory networks for animals, infrastructural networks for civilizations, social network for companies&#x2F;cities.<p>Quite frankly most of the articles on Geoffrey West&#x27;s work are hand-wavey bullshit, but he outlines it in this talk (including addressing this very question). <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DFFVSvAr7Wc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DFFVSvAr7Wc</a>',

            text: 'The difference is the ability for new firms to compete.<p>With centralized planning, there&#x27;s only one source.  If that source is inefficient or corrupt, that inefficiency and corruption stays around.  You can try to regulate, threaten, and police it, but nothing can really take it down.<p>By contrast, Walmart and Amazon might be very large, but they still have competition.  Heck, Amazon started less than 25 years ago.  Remember when Walmart was going to be the future of retail?  Well, now people say it&#x27;s Amazon.  So, it&#x27;s one generation for the crown to be passed?  Apple was in such dire straits that Michael Dell thought they should close up shop and return cash to shareholders.  Now look at Apple.  Yahoo had the chance to buy both Google and Facebook.  Heck, it wasn&#x27;t really until the 90s that Walmart became what it is today: Sears and Kmart were the big stores.<p>The point is that, while companies might have large barriers to entry, competition sneaks in.  Walmart looked like no one could compete with it.  Today, I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s precarious, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t look unstoppable.  Sears was huge and today people make jokes about it.<p>Companies like Amazon and Walmart create barriers to entry by building up capital.  It certainly does stop some competitors, but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve seen companies able to hold on for long.<p>It&#x27;s also not necessarily about whether the company turns a profit. Government-owned, centrally-planned companies don&#x27;t turn a profit, but they might be run incredibly inefficiently.  It&#x27;s not just Amazon&#x27;s low-profit range, but it&#x27;s efficiency that keeps it where it is.  Plenty of companies are being run right now with low to negative profits, but also not being run super efficiently.<p>How many companies have been &quot;the unstoppable juggernaut&quot; for 50+ years?  Can we name a few?  AT&amp;T isn&#x27;t the AT&amp;T from 30 years ago.  Remember when AT&amp;T had wireless and home TV and broadband and long distance was king?  Well, that company thought long distance was the future, spun off its wireless division and sold AT&amp;T broadband.  SBC eventually bought what was left of AT&amp;T on the cheap and renamed itself.  Microsoft was the unstoppable juggernaut... and then Apple and Google came along.  Walmart was that in the 90s and then Amazon came along, people started using other stores, etc.  Heck, Verizon and AT&amp;T seemed like no one could compete with them and then T-Mobile comes along and kicks of an era of amazing growth for them.  That&#x27;s an industry that relies on a limited amount of wireless spectrum that&#x27;s insanely hard to compete in and T-Mobile started grabbing all the industry growth and forcing the big two to lower their prices and offer unlimited.  American automotive companies were once kings and while they still exist, they&#x27;re a lot smaller and have lost that powerful position.  Office supply companies were big and everywhere and OfficeMax and OfficeDepot combined to survive and Staples doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything powerful.  I mean, Staples was started in the mid 80s and had a nice upward trajectory and seem to be on a graceful down-slope.  Heck, Blockbuster Video.  Talk about a staple of American life.  Despite stores everywhere, huge brand awareness, etc. they got toppled by Netflix.  Oh, Nokia!  They were huge and worth nearly 6x what they&#x27;re worth today a decade ago.  They saw the iPhone and just stalled out.  They saw Android and stalled.  Finally, Windows Mobile, but it was too late&#x2F;the wrong OS.<p>There are certain natural monopoly industries like utilities, but even in the cable TV&#x2F;internet industry, they&#x27;re looking less secure for the long run.  Many people are cord-cutters for TV, opting for Netflix and other internet-delivered video.  Many people watch on tablets which might use 4G rather than WiFi and that&#x27;s likely to accelerate over the next decade as wireless networks get much faster with much more bandwidth.  Tesla seems like it might want to compete with utilities over the long run with a combination of solar roofs and home battery packs.<p>Amazon is certainly powerful, but so was Walmart as Walmart scurries to stay in the game.  It&#x27;s hard to come up with companies that have really been that juggernaut for long.  Walmart was a relatively new entrant against entrenched retailers like Sears.  Amazon was a new entrant against Walmart.  It&#x27;s certainly not easy to unseat a powerful company, but it also seems difficult to stay at the top.  Whether it&#x27;s inefficiency, inability to pivot to new ways of doing things, or just markets that dry up as they&#x27;re replaced by something else, companies have a hard time staying in such powerful positions in our society for long.<p>And that&#x27;s the difference between a market with powerful companies and central planning.  Central planning would have said that Netflix isn&#x27;t a worthwhile attempt.  We already have all these stores, what will we do with the employees, isn&#x27;t it a waste to shutter so much investment and capital we&#x27;ve built up in the old way of doing things, the new model doesn&#x27;t look as good economically (yet), etc.  In fact, that&#x27;s basically what companies do.  Shipping DVDs?  Ridiculous.  You&#x27;re maybe paying $1 for the round-trip on the DVD (including labor) and charging $10&#x2F;mo for two out at a time?  Seems like it would never work.  Shipping books?  People want to browse at their bookstore, people want goods immediately, and shipping eats into profits.  Ridiculous!  Better search?  Nah, people want portal sites and Yahoo is the biggest!  The iPhone?  It doesn&#x27;t even have a keyboard which is an essential part of devices like Windows Mobile.  Wireless and cable?  We think the future of AT&amp;T is our long distance service which currently has better margins and lower investment cost than that newer technology.<p>When you have so much invested in one way of doing something, it can be hard to pivot as the world changes.  You become hesitant to kill your cash cows and might not try new things aggressively.  In a centrally planned economy, no one challenges that.  In a market economy, companies come along and do challenge that.  Even when offered their competitor, they often shrug them off!  Blockbuster was offered Netflix for $50M.  It wasn&#x27;t profitable at the time and seemed niche - PASS.  Yahoo was offered both Google and Facebook and thought the prices were too high.  Apple announced its iPhone 6-months in advance and most competitors just thought it was dumb.  Luckily, people can pursue these endeavors outside of one, centrally planned company.',

Which doesn&#x27;t necessarily bother me (I migrated to Trader Joe&#x27;s and similar competitors long ago), but does seem like a big deal in the grand scheme of things.  The grocery industry was heading in a Walmart-ish direction... and Whole Foods was almost single-handedly responsible for bringing a counterculture into the mainstream, and forcing all the other chains to reverse course and up their game.',

Not sure if it&#x27;s everywhere but where I live in Cincinnati, Amazon is now operating their own courier service for normal Prime deliveries piggybacking on top of Prime Now drivers.<p>When you place an order (on regular Amazon.com) you don&#x27;t necessarily know whether it will come from UPS, FedEx, an Amazon courier, etc.  The Amazon couriers don&#x27;t seem to know that it&#x27;s not a Prime Now order and that the delivery time isn&#x27;t known in advance to the customer like it is with Prime Now, as they show up midday and call you (from an unknown number) anticipating you&#x27;d be at home and asking you to let them in the gate.<p>One unexpected problem that emerges here is that the standard delivery service courier for a route is regular and that one person can be given a gate key; much harder to solve that with dozens or hundreds of couriers.',

                    text: 'I can&#x27;t emphasize enough how food is a fundamentally different business in so many ways.  First, to say the product is evaluated and experienced in a much more visceral way than most other industries is a <i>huge</i> understatement.<p>Our bodies, like most other animals, dedicate so many resources and features to the quality detection and digestion of food and our second largest concentration of nerve cells exists in our gut.  Eons before we could comparison shop, we and our evolutionary ancestors were foraging, testing and evaluating what we can eat.  How we evaluate this product is based on an innate system that been shaped over countless years.<p>When you eat something bad, that nervous system goes out of its way to tell your brain not to eat that thing again.  You may try to ignore it, but the brain has some pretty coercive methods to make sure you never forget what made you sick.  For me, it turned me off goat cheese for about 5 years, even though I knew I had come down with a stomach bug.  It didn&#x27;t matter.  My brain didn&#x27;t give a shit.  All it knows is I felt like shit after I ate goat cheese, so it&#x27;s going to tell me to stay away from fucking goat cheese.  (Fortunately, I can now enjoy it again.)<p>Needless to say, food borne illness is a huge concern with the industry because a handful of incidents (Think Chipotle) can have a devastating effect.  Want to prevent it?  You have two options:<p>The first option, you can go the preservation route with additives and refrigeration.  This is what we did in the 20th century.  We basically created conditions to make it hard for bacteria and pathogens to eat our food before we ate it.  Either this meant you kept it cold, or you made it inedible.  For example, one reason bleached white bread lasts longer than old fashioned sour dough recipes is because you&#x27;ve effectively stripped all the nutrients out of it.  Old fashioned bread is nutrient rich.  You can live off it.  The bleached bread was so nutrient poor that people started suffering from malnutrition diseases like rickets until some clever person realized you can fortify bread with flower.<p>Needless to say, most preservation systems take away something.  It could be nutrients, texture, flavor, or a host of other things.<p>The second option is to source fresh ingredients, handle it well, and eat it as soon as you can.  This is what Chipotle tried to do and what virtually no other fast food joint tries to do because it requires organizational and operational disciple.  The stakes are high and people have long memories when it comes to making people sick.  Even as adults, once you&#x27;ve associated doody with someone or something, that stuff sticks in your head.  I&#x27;m pretty sure when people started inventing verbal language, one of the first words that was uttered was something equivalent to the word &quot;yucky&quot;.<p>Now that we&#x27;ve got that illness and yuckiness are a huge part of this industry, you have to remember that food is also an artistic expression and part of people&#x27;s sense of identity, way more than most things you might buy on Amazon.  We have holidays that celebrate food bounties.  We use it to commune with friends and family.  Explorers set out expeditions and discovered entire fucking continents because they wanted better access to spices to make their food taste better.<p>Food is trendy, the customers are fickle and easy to scare and they have long memories.  As a company, you can&#x27;t just stumble into that industry and make it work robots and good operations procedures.  It takes inside knowledge and expertise that is cultivated by an organization.  This is why it was important for Amazon to buy a company that worked hard to try to figure out how to procure and provide fresh, health conscious, and sustainable foods.  They&#x27;re buying Whole Food&#x27;s reputation and expertise because they know reputation and expertise is everything in the food business.',

They enjoy high margins because they have cultivated quality and consciousness into their products.  They did to food what Apple did to computers.
